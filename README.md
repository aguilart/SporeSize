# SporeSize
AMF spore size project along perturbation
If you want to repeat the analysis you need three files:
1. "AMF_All_Copy" (the database with the AMF species and the spore size data);
2. "AMF_Taxonomy" (the data with the AMF accepted names and their synoyms. This one is created using the function "reestructure" that is on the R script "AMF_Taxonomy_Traits_Schlusser.R"); 
3. The specific study of AMF community compostion along a gradient of perturbation. 

"AMF_Taxonomy" is necesary because it translate the names used in particular study to the accepted names in the Schlusser website. Then spore size data can be assigned.
